            <h2>Peter Van Valkenburgh</h2>
            <p>Peter Van Valkenburgh is the Executive Director of Coin Center, a non-profit research and advocacy group focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency technologies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Previously, he was a founding board member of the Zcash Foundation, a non-profit charity dedicated to building financial privacy infrastructure for the public good, and an advisor to StarkWare, a company developing trust-minimized scaling solutions using zero-knowledge proof cryptography.</p>
            <p>Due to his expertise in these subjects, he has been invited to testify before the US Congress on six different occasions. He testified before the Senate Banking Committee and was the first witness before that body to offer a detailed explanation of Bitcoin and its financial regulatory implications.
