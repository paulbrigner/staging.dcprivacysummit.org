            <h2>Justin Thaler</h2>
            <p>Justin Thaler is Research Partner at a16z and an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Georgetown University. His research interests include verifiable computing, complexity theory, and algorithms for massive data sets. In 2011, he produced the first implementation of a general-purpose interactive proof system. He is the author of a comprehensive survey on SNARKs titled “Proofs, Arguments, and Zero-Knowledge,” and a co-creator of Apache DataSketches, an open-source library of production-quality streaming algorithms. Before joining a16z crypto and Georgetown, Justin was a Research Scientist at Yahoo Labs. Before that he completed his PhD in Computer Science at Harvard University.</p>

            <h2>Peter Van Valkenburgh</h2>
            <p>Peter Van Valkenburgh is the Executive Director of Coin Center, a non-profit research and advocacy group focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency technologies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Previously, he was a founding board member of the Zcash Foundation, a non-profit charity dedicated to building financial privacy infrastructure for the public good, and an advisor to StarkWare, a company developing trust-minimized scaling solutions using zero-knowledge proof cryptography.</p>
            <p>Due to his expertise in these subjects, he has been invited to testify before the US Congress on six different occasions. He testified before the Senate Banking Committee and was the first witness before that body to offer a detailed explanation of Bitcoin and its financial regulatory implications. He has also testified before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, the Financial Services and Energy and Commerce Committees of the House of Representatives.</p>
